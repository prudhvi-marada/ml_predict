#  AI + Fullstack Practice Project

This project is built to get **hands-on experience** in different layers of development:  
- **Machine Learning (Keras, scikit-learn)** for model building.  
- **Flask (Python backend)** for serving ML models as REST APIs.  
- **React + Vite (Frontend)** for creating an interactive UI.  
- **Bootstrap** for responsive styling.  

It is mainly a **practice project** to understand how ML models can be integrated with fullstack applications.

##  Tech Stack
###  Backend (Flask + ML)
- Python 3
- Flask (REST API)
- Flask-CORS (to handle cross-origin requests from frontend)
- Keras / TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas

###  Frontend (React + Vite)
- React (Components, Hooks, Routing)
- Axios (HTTP requests to backend)
- Bootstrap (styling, responsive design)

##  Features
1. **Digit Recognition**  
   - Upload an image of a handwritten digit.  
   - Image is preprocessed into a 28Ã—28 grayscale vector.  
   - Model (CNN trained on MNIST dataset) predicts digit.

2. **House Price Prediction**  
   - Enter housing features (like number of rooms, population, etc.).  
   - Model (trained on California Housing dataset) predicts median house value.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Enter a text review.  
   - Model predicts whether the sentiment is **Positive** or **Negative**.
